# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge
Import the data from 'lending_data.csv' using Pandas.

Make a prediction as to which model will perform better between Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier.

Create a feature DataFrame X by removing the 'loan_status' column and a label set y using the 'loan_status' column. Split the data into training and testing datasets using the train_test_split function.

Create a Logistic Regression model, fit it to the training data, and determine its score using the testing data. Repeat the process for a Random Forest Classifier, using any starting hyperparameters you like.

Compare the scores of both models and determine which one performed better. Compare your prediction with the actual result and write down your thoughts and results in a designated markdown cell.
